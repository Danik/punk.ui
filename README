A member of the FlashPunk community (Rolpege) started
a thread talking about a community UI project, and
that he just didn't know how to organize it.

I (Richard Marks) have started this project as my
first contribution towards the project.
Organization.

I've included stub class files for all the classes
that I felt we would need, and included a PNG of
the class inheritance design so you can see what is
what.

I recommend forking the repository and working on what you will,
and I will maintain the "official" repository.
You can submit your forks' implementations to me and
I will merge them as we go along.

Keep your changes in a branch with your username
and I will be able to keep track of the changes better.
