A member of the FlashPunk community (Rolpege) started
a thread talking about a community UI project, and
that he just didn't know how to organize it.

I (Richard Marks) have started this project as my
first contribution towards the project.
Organization.

I've included stub class files for all the classes
that I felt we would need, and included a PNG of
the class inheritance design so you can see what is
what.

There is a wiki for this project here on github:
